# Personal Website
#### Lucas Brambrink

This repository is for my personal website powered by **django** and **postgres**.
This application functions as a blog, online resume and node for hobby projects.

I hope to discuss coding related themes and showcase some of my skills as a programmer,
through words as well as the contents of this open source repo.

## Project Ideas
set up pi at home w static IP. set up secure web sockets and postgres database
from aws server/herokuapp, log user session data dynamically, using 
at least 2 separate queues for different functions, and kafka *required*
to write to this postgres database, maybe perform some backend function.
This is mainly as portfolio piece as a backend dev. use a mutex. 

Idea:
rpi that via HTTP/TCP can accept any script of .py/.js/others and execute



#### Notes

Professionally I use git with great precision and enthusiasm, celebrating its intricacies
that really shine in collaborative settings. This repository, however, falls short on all counts.
Indeed, most commit messages were automatically generated for ease of development.
