# Personal Website
#### Lucas Brambrink

This repository is for my personal website powered by **django** and **postgres**.
This application functions as a blog, online resume and node for hobby projects.

I hope to discuss coding related themes and showcase some of my skills as a programmer,
through words as well as the contents of this open source repo.

#### Notes

Professionally I use git with great precision and enthusiasm, celebrating its intricacies
that really shine in collaborative settings. This repository, however, falls short on all counts.
Indeed, most commit messages were automatically generated for ease of development.
